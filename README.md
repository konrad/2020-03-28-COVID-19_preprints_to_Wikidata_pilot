# COVID-19 bioRxiv and medRxiv pre-prints to Wikidata

Small scouting project to explore workflow for bringin COVID-19
related pre-prints from bioRxiv and medRxiv to Wikidata. Currently
there is no model for pre-prints.

It's rather quick and dirty solution with a combination of
wikidata-cli and preprocessing with Python. pywikibot might be a
cleaner solution but test commiting data where slow.
